# custom-react-template

Customized React project template for general use.

- Scripts and styles are seperated.
- All ".scss" files can be imported by "main.scss", so "index.js" file should import the one and only "main.scss"
- Devs can use the sass's benefits (Extending style classes, including mixins etc.) in this project structure.
